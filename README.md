We have a Clean India Portal where people can post about a location which is being neglected by the govt officials.The responsible and interested Organisations linked with our application - Govt as well as NGOs have a notification for the same. People can then verify the work has been done or not, It ensures complete transparency of work for the people, by the people.

We have a Food-Books Drive Portal so that NGOs can post about their drives and more people are aware about an ongoing event of charity.

Next we have a Health-Donation Portal where respected NGOs can raise funds from the community of people on our application.
